I made this script so I can use a simple interface for chatting with Language Models without the need to do lots of installations like what you would do with current local chat model interfaces.

This python script uses pipeline
It downloads the model in the tmeporary folder of your virtual environment (this is highly recommended) so you can chat with it locally.
